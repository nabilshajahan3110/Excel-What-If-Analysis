# Excel-What-If-Analysis
As part of a 75-day data analysis challenge, this work on Excel deals with What-If Analysis

Created by NABIL SHAJAHAN

As part of the challenge, I used a simple dataset of product sales to run two What-If Analyses.
I performed two scenario managers where the units_sold are increased and discount_rate are decreased. The new total sales values reflect these changes.
I also performed a goal seek where one of the products didn't achieve the target. Using this analysis, I was able to determine the required number of units_sold in order to achieve this target
